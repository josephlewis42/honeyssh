# 🍯 HoneySSH

HoneySSH is a medium interaction honeypot that provides attackers a fully simulated 
Linux shell to play in.

All commands are simulated and run in a per-session sandbox that's destroyed on
disconnect.

Features include:

* A relistic interactive shell.
* 50+ built-in POSIX commands.
* Payloads are captured with the fake `scp`, `wget` and `curl` commands for later analysis.
* Asciicast compatible session keystroke recording and playback.
* In-memory interactive file system.
* Reporting capabilities.
* Machine-readable JSON event log.

## Documentation

Most commands have help if you supply the `--help` flag.

### Running the honeypot

```bash
# Create a new configuration directory and enter it
mkdir honeypot && cd honeypot

# Initialize the configuration
honeyssh init

# Edit the configuration file config.yaml
nano config.yaml

# (Optional) Generate a new public key from a cryptographically secure RNG

# (Optional) Generate a custom file system image from a container
docker pull ubuntu:latest
docker save ubuntu:latest > tmp-image.tar
honeyssh img2fs tmp-image.tar root_fs.tar.gz

# Test your configuration using the playground functionality
honeyssh playground

# Start the honeypot
honeyssh serve
```

### Configuration

The current directory is used for configuration by default, but can be
overridden by the `--config` flag.

The configuration directory has the following items:

* `app.log`: SSH server event log newline delimited JSON events described by
  `core/logger/log.proto`.
* `config.yaml`: honeypot configuration, see the contents for descriptions of
  each item.
* `downloads`: items downloaded or uploaded by attackers to the honeypot, also
  includes metadata files about the invocation that caused the file to be placed
  here.
* `private_key`: private key the SSH server uses.
* `root_fs.tar.gz`: the root file system, by default this is adapted from
  `gcr.io/distroless`.
* `session_logs`: interactive session log recordings.

### Replaying the logs

Logs are found in the `session_logs` directory and are recorded in either
User Mode Linux (`.log` extension) or Asciicast (`.cast` extension) format.

```bash
# Print full output of recorded log to a terminal:
honeyssh logs cat path/to/some.log

# Replay the log in "real time" with a maximum pause of 30 seconds:
honeyssh logs play -i 30s path/to/some.log

# Convert a log to asciicast (asciinema) format.
honeyssh logs asciicast path/to/some.log > out.cast

# Convert an old Kippo log to asciicast (asciinema) format.
honeyssh logs asciicast --fix-kippo path/to/some.log > out.cast
```

### Generating interaction reports

`honeyssh` supports generating basic reports from the application logs file.
Run them using `honeyssh events REPORT_NAME` where the report name is one of the
following:

* `summary` Show a summary of events.
* `bugs` Show events that may have been caused by bugs in the Honeypot.
* `interactions` Show a summary of interactive sessions.

All reports allow the following flags:

* `--since duration` Display events newer than a relative duration. e.g. 24h, 45m, 60s.
* `--since-time` Display events after a specific date (RFC3339).

## Is it safe?

Maybe. As a medium interaction honeypot, it's more dangerous than a firewall
that denies all connections, but far safer than giving them access to a
machine/container that you hope you've plugged all the holes in.

Consider running `honeyssh` in [gVisor](https://github.com/google/gvisor) just in
case.
